# üìù Regions



{% hint style="warning" %}
**In the API, instead of regions, you pass in a country\_iso2 code**\


**eg.**

**For competitions in Canada your query would be:**\
`?country_iso2=CA`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember that only the first parameter has the ?, the rest of them have & symbols between them\
\
For example:\
www.example.com/api/v0?first\_param=3\&second=true\&third=yeah
{% endhint %}
